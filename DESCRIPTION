Title: eXtraction of ENTity
Description: Provides a tool for extracting information (entities and relations between them) in text datasets. It also emphasizes the results exploration with graphical displays. It is a rule-based system and works with hand-made dictionaries and local grammars defined by users. X.ent uses parsing with Perl functions and JavaScript to define user preferences through a browser and R to display and support analysis of the results extracted. Local grammars are defined and compiled with the tool Unitex, a tool developed by University Paris Est that supports multiple languages. See ?xconfig for an introduction.
